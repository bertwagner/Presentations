# The Analyst's Guide To Identifying and Fixing Performance Anti-Patterns


Are you waiting too long for your SQL-based analytical jobs to finish processing data? Would you prefer that those jobs finish in minutes instead of hours so your manager will stop asking if the results are available yet? 

Bert Wagner regularly helps analysts make minor changes to their SQL-based analytical jobs in order to dramatically improve performance. In this session he will show how to spot common analytical job performance anti-patterns as well as solutions for correcting them. 

Whether you strictly write SQL queries or incorporate those queries into tools like Python, R, SAS, SSIS, etcâ€¦ this session will teach you how to spot and fix low-hanging fruit performance opportunities.
