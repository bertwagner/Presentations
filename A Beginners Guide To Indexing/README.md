# I Want To Go Faster! An Introduction To Indexing

Youâ€™ve heard of indexes and have tried creating them in the past. However, instead of experiencing faster execution times, you saw little performance improvement and were left wondering if you indexed the right columns and whether you would have been better off building an index for every column in your table instead (hint: probably not). 

In this session you will learn the basics of creating performance improving indexes. We will discuss how to identify when a performance problem is due to a missing or poorly defined index, the secrets that allow indexes to make your queries run faster, and examples of how to create performance improving indexes for common querying scenarios. 

Whether you are a new DBA wanting to speed up the queries on your servers or a developer looking to make their applications run faster, this introduction to indexing will have you covered.
